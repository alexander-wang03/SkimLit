This project intends to build an NLP model to make reading medical abstracts easier.

It will take in medical papers as input and classify information under categories of: Background, Objectives, Methods, Results, and Conclusions.

It utilizes the PubMed 200k RCT Dataset described in *PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts* (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071)
